Instead of mailing fliers and coupons to a customer's home, an email marketing program sends marketing messages digitally to a customer's inbox.

Businesses can use email marketing in a variety of ways, such as to build brand loyalty, find new customers and encourage repeat business.</p>
    <p class="question-paragraph">Email marketing is one of the best marketing methods for earning business leads and has a very high ROI. The benefits to email marketing appear to be endless, but these six are the most important:</p>

    <p class="question-paragraph">Native advertising integrates advertisements with high-quality content in a less invasive way, preserving the immersive user-experience while improving brand awareness, building trust and improving click-through rates and sales.</p>
    <p class="question-paragraph">Native ads are often found in social media feeds, or as recommended content on a web page. Unlike display ads or banner ads, native ads don't really look like ads. They look like part of the editorial flow of the page. The key to native advertising is that it is non-disruptive - it exposes the reader to advertising content without sticking out like a sore thumb.</p>
    <p class="question-paragraph">Native ads are attention grabbers that drive traffic to your website and create awareness around your campaigns. Because native ads integrate with their host and rely on quality content for their value, they’re an ideal way to get your content seen. Native ads are proven to significantly outperform standard display ads. </p>
    <p class="question-paragraph">Consumers know that native ads are a form of advertising, but they don’t care! In a recent study at Stanford University, researchers found that native advertising fools nobody. Consumers are well aware that they are viewing a form of advertising, however native ads still have a significant effect on purchase behavior.</p>

    <p class="question-paragraph">Off-page SEO is about everything that doesn’t happen directly on your website. Optimizing your website is called on-page SEO and includes things like site structure, content and speed optimizations. Off-page SEO is about, among other things, link building, social media, and local SEO. Or in other words, generating traffic to your website and making your business appear like the real deal it is.</p>
    <p class="question-paragraph">Off-page SEO relies on human behavior (namely, that people only reference and share content they like). As such, it applies to both organic and local SEO. Even in a brick-and-mortar business, high-quality products get a lot of word-of-mouth referrals from current customers — the in-person equivalent of off-page SEO.</p>
    <p class="question-paragraph">At a high level, improving the "off-page SEO" of a website involves improving search engine and user perception of a site's quality. This happens by getting links from other sites (especially those that are reputable and trustworthy themselves), mentions of your brand, shares of your content, and "votes of confidence" from sources outside of your own website.</p>
