						Online advertising offers brands a raft of opportunities to reach specific audience demographics with precision and efficiency.
					</p>
					<p class="service-paragraph">
						The most common types of online advertising are paid search advertising (also known as pay-per-click or PPC), social media advertising, display ads, and email marketing. Paid online advertising is one of the most efficient ways of reaching new customers at the time they are most likely to buy your products or services. Depending on your goals, you pay either whenever someone engages with your ads or based on impressions (how many times your ad was shown).

						Search engine optimization or SEO means the process of improving your website to increase its visibility for relevant searches. The better visibility your pages have in search results, the more likely you are to garner attention and attract prospective and existing customers to your business.
					</p>
					<p class="service-paragraph">
						SEO is a fundamental part of digital marketing because people conduct trillions of searches every year, often with commercial intent to find information about products and services. Search is often the primary source of digital traffic for brands and complements other marketing channels. Greater visibility and ranking higher in search results than your competition can have a material impact on your bottom line.

					</div>
					<p class="service-paragraph">
						Social media marketing, or SMM, is a form of internet marketing that involves creating and sharing content on social media networks in order to achieve your marketing and branding goals. Social media marketing includes activities like posting text and image updates, videos, and other content that drives audience engagement, as well as paid social media advertising.
					</p>
					<p class="service-paragraph">
						Social media marketing is no longer just an alternative but essential for a balanced marketing mix. It helps to influence the way your customers perceive you and is a key factor in improving traffic and page rankings. Social media marketing services have numerous advantages for startups and established brands. With the right social media marketing plan and campaign monitoring system, social media content marketing can lead to increased search traffic, better SEO, healthier customer engagement and improved brand loyalty.

					</div>
					<p class="service-paragraph">
						Affiliate marketing is a popular tactic to drive sales and generate significant online revenue. Affiliate marketing is the process by which an affiliate earns a commission for marketing another person’s or company’s products. The affiliate simply searches for a product they enjoy, then promotes that product and earns a piece of the profit from each sale they make. 
					</p> 
					<p class="service-paragraph">
						We specialize in offering affiliate program solutions that grabs attention of your potential affiliates, which in turn increases lead generation and sales. Our affiliate management service takes all the stress and hard work out of managing your affiliates, setting up links, arranging new promotions, and working with your affiliate account manager.
					</p> 

					<p class="service-paragraph">
						The more people who are advertising your company, services, or products online, the more successful you will be. An affiliate marketing program is essentially a sales force compensated based on their performance. Only pay for performance by setting guidelines with affiliates for the KPIs that matter most to your bottom line.

        <h3 class="question-title">Display Advertising</h3>
        <p class="question-paragraph">One of the most favourable and widely used types of online advertising, display advertising comes in a variety of formats including banners, images, videos and rich media. </p>

        <p class="question-paragraph">The visual assets are distributed across specific websites, apps or social media platforms. </p>

        <p class="question-pname">BANNER ADS</p>
        <p class="question-paragraph">Banner ads are image-based ads that appear at the top, bottom or sides of a website. They come in various sizes and shapes. The horizontal ones are leaderboards, while vertical banners are called skyscrapers.</p> 

        <p class="question-pname">INTERSTITIAL ADS</p>
        <p class="question-paragraph">These are the full-screen ads that pop up on a website or app interface before a user reaches the page they were intending to visit. Due to their high impact and visibility, they tend to achieve a high click-through rate.</p>

        <p class="question-pname">RICH MEDIA ADS</p>
        <p class="question-paragraph">What makes rich media ads different to static banner ads is that they include advanced features such as audio, video or interactive Call-to-Action buttons. The format is designed to encourage users to interact and engage with the content.</p>

        <p class="question-paragraph">Paid search:</p>
        <ul class="question-list">
          <li class="qlist-item">has an almost instant impact</li>
          <li class="qlist-item">can give you first page exposure on major search engines</li>
          <li class="qlist-item">can send immediate and consistent traffic to your website</li>
